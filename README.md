# CreepDetector-WiGLE
WiGLE CSV compatible [CreepDetector](https://github.com/skickar/CreepDetector) remake.

## Limitations

- WiGLE is meant to save Wi-Fi networks (access points), not (un)associated devices. Therefore, this script is far from a complete solution.

## Installation

### Python Version

* Python 3.13

### Python Packages

- Haversine
- Pandas
- Folium

### Using pip

1) Recommendation: Create a new virtual environment using `python -m venv .venv` inside the project's folder. Activate using your platform's script under `.venv/Scripts/` (e.g. activate.bat for Windows, activate for Linux).

2) Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
