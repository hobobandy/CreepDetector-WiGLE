# CreepDetector-WiGLE
WiGLE CSV compatible [CreepDetector](https://github.com/skickar/CreepDetector) remake.

## Limitations

- WiGLE is meant to save Wi-Fi networks (access points), not (un)associated devices. Therefore, this script is far from a complete solution.

## Requirements

### Python Packages

- Haversine
- Pandas
- Folium

## Credits

Based on the work of [skickar](https://github.com/skickar) and [Alex Lynd](https://github.com/AlexLynd), check out the original [CreepDetector](https://github.com/skickar/CreepDetector)!
